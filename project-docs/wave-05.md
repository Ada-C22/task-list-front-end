# Wave 05: Adding a Form

**Learn Topics: Handling Forms required for this wave**

In Wave 05 we will add a feature to create a new Task. For this wave you should make sure that that you are on the `main` branch.
- Create a `NewTaskForm`
- Submitting a `NewTaskForm` should 
    - add rendered `Task`s to the `App` and 
    - trigger a `POST` request to Task List API to create a new `task` in the database.
